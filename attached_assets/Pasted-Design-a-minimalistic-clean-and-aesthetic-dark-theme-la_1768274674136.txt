Design a minimalistic, clean, and aesthetic dark-theme landing page for a global fantasy market simulation platform.

DESIGN PHILOSOPHY:
- Ultra-clean layout
- High contrast, lots of negative space
- Calm, premium, trustworthy
- No flashy neon, no gaming overload
- Looks like a modern fintech + design-first product
- Apple × Stripe × Linear energy

COLOR SYSTEM:
- Background: pure black / charcoal (#0A0A0A, #0F172A)
- Text: soft white / gray (#E5E7EB, #9CA3AF)
- Accent: ONE muted color only (soft blue or muted purple)
- No gradients unless extremely subtle
- No glow effects

TYPOGRAPHY:
- Font: Inter / Satoshi / SF-style
- Large, confident hero text
- Simple font hierarchy
- No unnecessary bolding

HERO SECTION:
- Centered layout
- Headline: “Understand Markets. Risk Nothing.”
- Subtext: “Explore global markets using free virtual credits. No money. No noise. Just learning.”
- Single primary CTA: “Start Free”
- No background animation, only subtle grain or soft noise texture

MARKETS SECTION:
- Minimal grid with text-only cards:
  - Stocks
  - Indices
  - Crypto
  - Commodities
  - Forex
- Each card:
  - Thin border
  - Soft hover highlight
  - No icons, no images

HOW IT WORKS:
Simple 4-step horizontal flow:
1. Get free credits
2. Choose a market
3. Allocate & simulate
4. See where you rank

Use thin dividers and subtle transitions.

FEATURES SECTION:
Short, quiet statements:
- Free virtual credits
- No buying or selling
- Algorithm-driven simulation
- Skill-based ranking

No illustrations. Text does the work.

LEADERBOARD PREVIEW:
- Minimal table
- Monospace numbers
- Clean spacing
- No colors except accent for top rank

DISCLAIMER:
Very subtle, low-contrast text:
“This is a market simulation using virtual credits only. No real money involved.”

FOOTER:
- Extremely minimal
- One line
- No clutter
- No social overload

INTERACTIONS:
- Smooth fades
- Gentle hover states
- No bouncing, no flashy motion
- Feels calm and intentional

TECH:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Tailwind CSS preferred
- Fully responsive
- Accessibility-friendly
- No backend integration

OUTPUT:
Return full, clean, production-ready code for the landing page.
